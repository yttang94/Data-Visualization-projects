# IMDB Database
First project

Here is an IMDB database I have obtained from year 1960+ to 2015. Using this database, I will try to find out a few interesting/ fun questions as well as exploring the trends in movie making over the years with data visualization.

Packages Used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 
Plot created: Piechart, Barplot, Scatterplot, Heatmap

Trivia questions:
1. Who are the directors that earned most (top 20)
2. How big of a revenue pie has the top 20 taken up among all directors
3. Who are the actors that appeared in most movies
4. What are the genres that showed up most

2. Does budget and grossing correlate?
3. Does movie rating and grossings correlate?
4. What are the appearance of genre over the years?
